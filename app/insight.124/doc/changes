  protection faults.


Insight 1.23 (2008-10-24)
=========================

* Alt+Z in the Dump window expands/shrinks it.
* Home/End now work in the Dump window.
* F6: skip current instruction.
* Fixed: ^A in the Code window do not update the Stack window (try to change
  SP and then restore it in previous versions).
* Stack window combined with Local variables / Function arguments window.
  Content of both windows can be edited (Shift+S in the Code window).
* Fixed: CPU type displayed incorrectly on P-4. Thanks to Robert Riebisch.
* Added 2nd page to the internal Help.
* Current address of the Dump window and the Stack window displayed
  if corresponding window is in edit mode.
* Current line in the Code window is highlighted even if this window is
  inactive.
* Insight can be compiled with NASM 2.0+. Patch by Alex Buell.
* Added support for some undocumented instructions. Suggested by Robert
  Riebisch.
* whatsnew.* are no longer maintained. All changes are described in `changes'
  and `changes.rus'. Significant changes are marked with *, others -- with +.
+ bp.inc: added comments and optimizations.
+ Fixed: incorrect color of a shadow if atShadow != 7.
+ ...


Insight 1.22 (2007-11-24)
=========================

* Fixed: Insight hangs on 8086 and 286 machines after pressing Ctrl+R
  in the Code or Registers window.
* Fixed: incorrect initial addresses of Code and Dump windows after
  loading program using F3.
* Fixed: cursor in the code window disappears after executing INT 20 or
  INT 21 / 4C instruction using Run|Step over.
* Added support for screen modes 90x25, 90x30, etc. This support requires
  changes in the Makefile and recompilation.
* Fixed: there was no DOS function number in AH in restore_dta procedure.
* Zero-bytes are highlighted in the Dump window.
* English documentation (insight.txt) corrected. Thanks to Goxygen.
* Changed e-mail address of Sergey Pimenov.
+ Optimizations in windows.inc, dialogs.inc, iface.inc.
+ chksize removed.


Insight 1.21 (2007-03-11)
=========================

* Added List Memory Blocks command (^M in the code window).
* Added Animate command (Run|Animate).
* Large dump window if the screen have more than 25 lines and /e switch
  is used.
* Command line, specified via Run|Arguments, now may be up to 126 bytes
  long. (Was: up to 80 bytes.)
+ Added comments to some procedures.
+ src\makefile fixed: `..\tools\nasm' changed to `nasm'.
+ Updated description of mkhelp in tools\tools.txt.


Insight 1.20 (2007-02-05)
=========================

* Fixed: ^C in Registers Window do not restore CS:IP.
* Fixed: program's SP on startup was incorrect.
* Show return code and termination type when program terminates.
* Correct saving and restoring screen on VGA.
* Added /e switch (EGA mode -- do not save font and VGA registers).
* Line of hex digit above ASCII-part of Dump Window.
* Alt-U: dump user screen. (Dump of buffer in Insight's data area.)
* Help (F1 in code window).
* Enter == ^F, Backspace == ^P in code window.
* Sources converted to NASM format.
+ Names of almost all constants uppercased. (Except for kb*, at*.)
+ menus.inc: all *menu.inc files in one file.
+ no_cursor, small_cursor, large_cursor added.
+ colors.inc now contains definitions of colors of all elements.
+ Crypt-related stuff removed.
+ Palette-related stuff removed.
+ Size of window buffer increased to 2800 bytes.
+ Conditional compilation removed.
+ Makefile, uclpack.exe, mkhelp.exe, chksize.exe added.
+ strlen optimized.
+ edit_registers/update_registers optimized.
+ fill_byte / fill_word / fill_dword optimized.
+ And other minor changes...


Insight 1.10 (2002-01-26)
=========================

* Source code of the debugger is released under GNU GPL.


Insight 1.01 (1997-05-07)
=========================

* Corrected displaying of data on invalid address for instruction that
  refers on that data. As effect corrected invalid positioning of dump
  window when using Alt+=. [Alex Trubin, 2:5030/620.12]
* Corrected expansion of immediate operand to doubleword in instructions
  like cmp eax,-1.
* Corrected execution of Proc Step for 16-bit conditionaljumps.
* Corrected displaying of 32-bit memory cells for instruction of 386+ CPU
  (earlier displayed as 16-bit).
* Size of operand displayed correctly (dword ptr instead of word ptr) for
  instructions of 386+ CPU which work with 32-bit data.
* Size of mem-operand is showed (byte ptr, for example) for instructions
  like movzx/movsx reg,mem.
* The Follow function now understands 16-it conditional jumps. Direction
  and truth of jump displayed correctly.
* Alt+L in the Dump window works now.
* Current byte is highlighted in both parts of the Dump window during
  editing. [Alexey Andreev, 2:5030/353.99]
* Bug: disassembler hangs if disassembled segment completely filled with
  prefixes.
